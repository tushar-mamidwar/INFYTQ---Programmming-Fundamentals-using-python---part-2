Problem Statement
Fortune hotel wants to automate their daily activities such as check in and check out. There are
two types of rooms- Standard and Luxury. Free wifi is available in Luxury room and comfortable desk
is available in standard room.

Write a python program to implement the class diagram given below.


Class description
Customer class:
    1. Initialize static variable counter to 1000

Hotel class:
    1. room_list: List of objects of rooms in the hotel
    2. check_in(customer, room_type): Check-in the given customer based on details mentioned below.
        1. Customer can check in, only if the type of room desired by the customer is available.
        2. If the room is available,
            - Auto-generate room.customer.customer_id starting from 1001
            - Assign the customer to the available room
            - Return true
        3. Else, return false
    3. check_out(customer): Check-out the given customer based on details mentioned below.
        1. Find out the room allocated to the given customer. If found,
            - Identify the room rent based on type and number of days stayed by the customer
            - Release the room, i.e., the room should be available for check in by other customers.
            - Return total room rent
        2. Else, return false

Room class:
    1. Initialize static variable counter to 100
    2. Auto-generate room_id in the child class constructors starting from 101 and prefixed by
    "L" for luxury room and "S" for Standard room. Examples â€“ S101, L102, S103, L104, L105 etc.

LuxuryRoom class:
    calculate_room_rent(no_of_days): Calculate room rent
        1. Calculate room rent based on room price and number of days
        2. For stay of more than 5 days, provide 5% discount on total room rent
        3. Return the final room rent

StandardRoom class:
    calculate_room_rent(no_of_days): Calculate room rent
        1. Calculate room rent based on room price and number of days
        2. Return the calculated room rent

Perform case sensitive comparison.

Create objects of Hotel class, invoke appropriate methods and test your program.
