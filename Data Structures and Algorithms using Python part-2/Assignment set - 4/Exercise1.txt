Question:
By playing the number guessing game, you have actually searched for a number in a list of numbers using a
simple search algorithm.

Here are the set of steps that forms that algorithm but provided in a jumbled order. Go through the steps 
and drag and drop it into the pseudo-code box in the correct sequence.

ANSWER:

Pseudo-code
initialize number of guesses to 0
input number to be guessed and list of numbers
for each number in the list of numbers
increment number of guesses by 1
if number is equal to number to be guessed
display success message
break
else
display try again message
end-if
end-for
display number of guesses
